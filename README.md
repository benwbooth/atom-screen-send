# screen-send package

Send selected text to various terminals in Atom.

Use the F4 key to select a terminal session, and F5 to send text to the selected session. If no text is selected, the current paragraph under the cursor is sent. Markdown-style code blocks are supported; the surrounding triple-backticks are automatically removed.
